ChangeLog
=========
2. Jan. 21, 2009
   The FEs for subcomponent optimization in eacy cycle is changed to 200*100=2e4
   to achieve a better performance.

1. Sept. 1, 2008
   Fixed the bug in f3 of the classical benchmark functions. The result of f3
   is worse than the result in [1] now. Previously, f3 is implemented wrongly,
   and now the correct version is much more difficult to optimize.
   In benchmark/benchmark_func.m
   
   Before change:
   line 78         tmp = tmp + x(k, i)*x(k, i);
   line 79         ft = ft + tmp;
   
   After change:
   line 78         tmp = tmp + x(k, i);
   line 79         ft = ft + tmp*tmp;


Notice
======
1. Jan 21, 2009
   Only the classical benchmark functions were released together with this 
   software, since the package of CEC'2005 functions contains a lot of data
   files and is very big. 
   The CEC'2005 test suite can be found in Dr. Suganthan's Homepage: 
   http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/EPNSugan/
